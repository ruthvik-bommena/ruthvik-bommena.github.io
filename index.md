## About

Ruthvik Bommena is a PhD Candidate in Aerospace Engineering and a Graduate Research Assistant in the Computation, Optimization, Simulation, and Modeling of Orbiting Spacecraft (COSMOS) Laboratory at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). He holds a Master’s degree in Aerospace Engineering from UIUC and a Bachelor’s degree in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Illinois Chicago. Beyond academia, Ruthvik also holds a Private Pilot License, which he earned from the Institute of Aviation at Parkland College.

Ruthvik Bommena's research primarily focuses on developing path-constrained optimal guidance and control strategies for in-space servicing and assembly missions (ISAM) using multi-agent satellite swarms. Why does this matter? Imagine decommissioning a billion-dollar space telescope or a satellite just because it ran out of fuel. Or being limited by how much a rocket can carry to space. Instead, we can use ISAM to solve these problems. It’s like giving spacecraft a second (or third) chance at life through rocket science—promoting spacecraft reusability and space sustainability.
