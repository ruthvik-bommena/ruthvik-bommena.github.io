## About

Ruthvik Bommena is a PhD Candidate in Aerospace Engineering and a Graduate Research Assistant in the Computation, Optimization, Simulation, and Modeling of Orbiting Spacecraft (COSMOS) Laboratory at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). He holds a Master’s degree in Aerospace Engineering from UIUC and a Bachelor’s degree in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Illinois Chicago. Beyond academia, Ruthvik also holds a Private Pilot License, which he earned from the Institute of Aviation at Parkland College.

Ruthvik Bommena's research primarily focuses on developing path-constrained optimal guidance and control strategies for in-space servicing and assembly missions (ISAM) using multi-agent satellite swarms. Why does this matter? Imagine decommissioning a billion-dollar space telescope or a satellite just because it ran out of fuel. Or being limited by how much a rocket can carry to space. Instead, we can use ISAM to solve these problems. It’s like giving spacecraft a second (or third) chance at life through rocket science—promoting spacecraft reusability and space sustainability.

Join me on this journey as we work to make space exploration smarter, more efficient, and kinder to us and to the universe.
