I'm Ruthvik Bommena, a PhD student in Aerospace Engineering at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.  
My work centers on space mission design, spacecraft autonomy, and guidance & control systems for in-space servicing and assembly.

In my academic and research journey so far, I've worked on:
- Satellite swarm trajectory optimization
- Thruster-based attitude control
- Low-thrust multi-revolution transfers

Outside of research, I enjoy skydiving, hiking, and adventure sports.
