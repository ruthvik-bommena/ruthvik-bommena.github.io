## Industry Experience

#### **Flight Dynamics Intern**, Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) 
*Bengaluru, India* | May 2025 – Jul 2025  
  - Developed an optimal impulsive trajectory design framework for Earth-return missions from lunar orbit, at ISRO’s U R Rao Satellite Centre.
  - Developed custom MATLAB/Python tools to compute minimum ΔV transfers, using optimal control theory and nonlinear programming, while enforcing lunar-departure, Earth-reentry, and dynamical constraints.
  - Executed a year-long search for 2027 to find optimal return windows, delivering validated solution sets that support mission planning for ISRO’s upcoming lunar sample-return missions.

#### **Mechanical Design Intern**  
*Skyroot Aerospace* | *Hyderabad, India* | May 2021 – Aug 2021 
  - Designed and tested gimbal mounts for the Raman-I RCS engine on the Vikram-I rocket.  
  - Conducted FEA simulations for structural and thermal integrity validation.  
  - Gained skills in CAD, thrust vectoring, and technical report writing.

#### **Engineering Intern**  
*Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO)* | *Hyderabad, India* | May 2019 – Jul 2019
  - Contributed to the fabrication process of a strategic defense system at the Research Centre Imarat (Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam Complex).  
  - Developed an innovative integration method for modular system components to ensure structural integrity and aerodynamic stability.  
  - Gained hands-on experience with modular aerospace systems and non-destructive testing for structural verification.

## Academic Experience

#### **Graduate Research Assistant**  
*University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC)* | *Champaign, IL* | Aug 2022 – Present
  - Designing advanced GNC algorithms for satellite servicing rendezvous and proximity operations.  
  - Developed 6-DOF path-constrained trajectory optimization strategies for in-space servicing and assembly missions using multi-agent swarms.  
  - Applied indirect optimization techniques with constraints such as anti-collision and thruster-pointing for collision and contamination avoidance.

#### **Technical Support Specialist**  
*SHIELD Illinois* | *Champaign, IL* | Nov 2021 – Jun 2023
  - Delivered technical support for the University of Illinois’ COVID-19 testing initiative.  
  - Resolved support tickets and managed client interaction with tracking software.  
  - Led knowledge-base improvements and enhanced customer satisfaction workflows.

#### **Teaching Assistant – AE402: Orbital Mechanics**  
*University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC)* | *Champaign, IL* | Aug 2022 – Dec 2022
  - Assisted students with coursework through office hours and assignment grading.  
  - Delivered lectures in the instructor's absence, contributing to curriculum delivery.  
  - Supported students in exam prep and technical comprehension.

#### **Undergraduate Student Assistant**  
*University of Illinois Chicago (UIC)* | *Chicago, IL* | Sep 2018 – Apr 2019
  - Worked in the Machine Shop and Makerspace labs with subtractive and additive manufacturing tools.  
  - Operated CNC/manual mills, routers, 3D printers, and laser cutters.  
  - Gained expertise in lab safety, CAD modelling for machining and 3D printing, and post-processing.
